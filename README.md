# What is Forlorn?

Forlorn is a game on IOS which was developed by Robert Topala, the Creator of well known games such as Boomlings and Geometry Dash and 2 other individuals. They shared teasers of their game under the YouYube channel called [Rune Digital Games](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDi6Bibo-8B32Q_cuEvWQJQ)

## Is there a way to play the game?

As of right now, no. The game was unfinished and was scrapped shortly after being entered into the [Swedish Game Awards](https://www.gameawards.se/). When [RobTop](https://geometry-dash.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Topala) was asked about forlorn and possibly releasing the unavailable build he stated that `forlorn is dead` and `it stopped working` because `apple kept changing their stuff`
